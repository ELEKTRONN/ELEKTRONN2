Introduction
============


What is ELEKTRONN2?
-------------------

ELEKTRONN2 is a flexible and extensible **Python toolkit** that facilitates **design,**
**training and application of neural networks**.

It can be used for general machine learning tasks, but its main focus is on
**convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high-throughput 3D and 2D image analysis**.

ELEKTRONN2 is especially useful for efficiently assessing experimental
neural network architectures thanks to its **powerful interactive shell** that can be
entered at any time during training, temporarily pausing all calculations.

The shell interface provides shortcuts and autocompletions for
frequently used operations (e.g. adjusting the learning rate)
and also provides a complete python shell with full read/write access to the network model, the
plotting subsystem and all training parameters and hyperparameters.
Changes made in the shell take effect immediately, so you can **monitor, analyse and**
**manipulate your training sessions directly during their run time**, without losing
any training progress.

Computationally expensive calculations are **automatically compiled and transparently**
**executed as highly-optimized CUDA** binaries on your GPU if a CUDA-compatible
graphics card is available [#f1]_.

ELEKTRONN2 is written in Python (2.7 / and 3.4+) and is a complete rewrite of the
previously published `ELEKTRONN <http://elektronn.org>`_ library. The largest
improvement is the development of a **functional interface that allows easy creation of**
**complex data-flow graphs** with loops between arbitrary points in contrast to
simple "chain"-like models.
Currently, the only supported platform is Linux (x86_64).

.. [#f1] You can find out if your graphics card is compatible
  `here <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus>`_.
  Usage on systems without CUDA is possible but generally not recommended
  because it is very slow.


Use cases
---------

Although other high-level libraries are available (Keras, Lasagne), they all
lacked desired features_ and flexibility for our work,
mostly in terms of an intuitive method to specify complicated computational
graphs and utilities for training and data handling, especially in the domain
of specialised large-scale 3-dimensional image data analysis for
`connectomics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectomics>`_ research
(e.g. tracing, mapping and segmenting neurons in in SBEM [#f2]_ data sets).

Although the mentioned use cases are ELEKTRONN2's specialty, it can be used and
extended for a wide range of other tasks thanks to its modular object-oriented
API design_ (for example, new operations can be implemented as subclasses of the
`Node <http://elektronn2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/elektronn2.neuromancer.html#elektronn2.neuromancer.node_basic.Node>`_
class and seamlessly integrated into neural network models).

.. [#f2] `Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy <http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020329>`_,
  a method to generate high resolution 3D images from small samples, such as
  brain tissue.

Technology
----------

As the back-end we chose `Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>`_
because of good prior experience and competitive performance.
With Theano, symbolic computational graphs can be created, in which nodes stand
for operations and edges carry values (input and output can be seen as a special
operation i.e. a node).
Theano is able to compile a graph into a binary executable for different targets
(CPU, openMP, GPUs with CUDA support); highly optimised routines from numerical
libraries for those targets (e.g. BLAS, cuBLAS, cuDNN) will be used for
corresponding operations. Using a symbolic graph facilitates automatic
differentiation and optimisation of the graph prior to compilation (e.g. common
subexpression elimination, fusion of composed element-wise operations, constant
folding). For (convolutional) neural networks the GPU is the most efficient
target and Theano can itself be seen as a back-end for low-level CUDA.

Installation
------------

.. note:: ELEKTRONN2 is supported on Linux (x86_64), with Python versions
  2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.
  Everything else is untested, but some other platforms might work as well.
  Please create an `issue <https://github.com/ELEKTRONN/ELEKTRONN2/issues>`_ if
  you are interested in support for other platforms.


Installing with ``pip``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can install the current git version of ELEKTRONN2 and all of its
dependencies with the ``pip`` package manager. For Python 3, run::

  python3 -m pip install numpy # numpy has to be installed manually first!
  python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/ELEKTRONN/ELEKTRONN2

Or if you want to install ELEKTRONN2 for Python 2::

  python2 -m pip install numpy # numpy has to be installed manually first!
  python2 -m pip install git+https://github.com/ELEKTRONN/ELEKTRONN2

We suggest that you do this inside a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`_
or a `conda env <https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html>`_ to prevent conflicts
with system packages.

.. TODO: Manual numpy install is only necessary because numba doesn't provide
  wheels. Once wheels are public, delete the "pip install numpy" lines.

.. TODO: Maybe describe an example setup of a virtualenv.

Arch Linux (AUR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use Arch Linux, you can install the
`ELEKTRONN2 AUR package <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-elektronn2-git/>`_
by running::

  pacaur -S python-elektronn2-git # for Python 3
  pacaur -S python2-elektronn2-git # for Python 2

.. note:: In the Python 2 AUR package, the ``elektronn2-train`` command is
  named ``elektronn2-train2`` to prevent file name conflicts.


.. TODO: conda/conda-forge install once we have a tagged release


.. _design:

Design principles
=================

ELEKTRONN2 adds another abstraction layer to Theano. To create a model, the
user has to connect different types of node objects and thereby builds a graph
as with Theano. But the creation of the raw Theano graph, composed of symbolic
variables and trainable model parameters, is hidden and managed through usage
of sensible default values and bundling of stereotypical Theano operations into
a single ELEKTRONN2 node.
For example, creating a convolution layer consists of initialising weights,
performing the convolution, adding the bias, applying the activation function
and optional operations such as dropout or batch normalisation. Involved
parameters might be trainable (e.g. convolution weights) or non-trainable but
changeable during training (e.g. dropout rates).


Nodes and layers
----------------

Nodes automatically keep track of their parents and children, parameters, computational
cost, output shape, spatial field of view, spatial strides etc. Users can call a node object
simply like a numpy function. The corresponding Theano compilation is done on demand
upon first call; all arguments Theano needs for the compilation process are automatically
gathered from the node meta data. Methods for profiling, checking the correct output
shape or making dense predictions with a (strided) CNN on arbitrarily shaped input are
additionally provided. Shapes are augmented with usage tags e.g. 'x', 'y', 'z' for spatial
axes, 'f' for the feature axis.

Nodes are mostly generic, e.g. the ``Perceptron`` node can operate on any input by reading
from the input shape tags which axis the dot product should be applied over, irrespective
of the total input dimensionality. Likewise there is only one type of convolution node
which can handle 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional convolutions and determines the case based on
the input shape tags, it does also make replacements of the convolution operation if this
makes computation faster: for a 3-dimensional convolution where the filter size is 1 on
the z-axis using a 2-dimensional convolution back-end is faster for gradient computation;
convolutions where all filter shapes are 1 can be calculated faster using the dot product.


Network models
--------------

Whenever a ``Node`` is created, it is registered internally to a ``model`` object which also
records the exact arguments with which the node was created as node descriptors. The
model provides an interface for the trainer by designating nodes as input, target, loss
and monitoring outputs. The model also offers functions for plotting the computational
graph as image, and showing statistics about gradients, neuron activations and parameters
(mean, standard deviation, median).

Furthermore, the ``model`` offers methods loading and saving from/to disk. Because for this
the descriptors are used and not the objects itself, these can programmatically be manipulated
before restoration of a saved graph.
This is used for:
* changing input image size of a CNN (including sanity check of new shape),
* inserting Max-Fragment-Pooling (MFP) into a CNN that was trained without MFP,
* marking specific parameters as non-trainable for faster training,
* changing batch normalisation from training mode to prediction mode
* creating a one-step function from a multi-step RNN.
